                <h1>It’s a love story (Between us and Slipcovers)</h1>
                <p>Our story revolves around a couple and a sofa. It started with a date when he was extra anxious that she would spill the wine on his landlord’s furniture. Then came another night when she was laying down on the sofa buying various Etsy decor to make her no-longer-man’s cave a bit more liveable, and eventually came the days when they started Homeleon on the same couch to finally have a place to call their home (and save this sofa, of course).”
